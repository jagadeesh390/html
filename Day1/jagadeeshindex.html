    <h1>SDLC</h1>
    <P>Software Developemnt Lifecycle</P>
    <pre>
        SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.
        SDLC is a systematic process that guides the development and maintenance of software applications.
        The life cycle provides a structured approach to planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining software systems, ensuring efficiency, quality, and reliability throughout the development process.
        Key Stages of SDLC
        <ul>
            <li>Planning:</li>
            <p> 
                Defining the project scope, goals, timelines, and resource requirements.
                Conducting feasibility studies to assess project viability.
            </p>
            <li>Analysis:</li>
            <p> 
                Gathering and analyzing requirements from stakeholders.
                Defining the system architecture and specifications.
            </p>
            <li>Design:</li>
            <p> 
                Creating a blueprint for the software system, outlining its structure and components.
                Defining the user interface, databases, and other technical specifications.
            </p>
            <li>Implementation (Coding)</li>:
            <p> 
                Writing the actual code based on the design specifications.
                Conducting unit testing to ensure individual components work correctly.
            </p>
            <li>Testing:</li>
            <p>
                Conducting various testing phases, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
            Identifying and fixing defects to ensure the software meets quality standards.
            </p>
